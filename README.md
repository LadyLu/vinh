its ya boi


Basically copy the files word for word
dont fuck up the procfile its the most important
uhhhh ok im just gonna write everything here

you need a github and heroku account
write your files here in github like the ones ive got here but obviously change the triggers and shit
make sure they're named exactly the same tho

go onto discord/myapps and create your bot
make sure you flip the switch under the bot category after you make the app itself

once all the files are set go onto heroku
first link your new project to your github repository under the deploy tab
also under that tab enable automatic deploys

then go into settings and then reveal config variables
make a new one with BOT_TOKEN as they key
then for the value, go under the app in discord again and scroll down until you find the bot token, click reveal, and then copy and paste it into the value for the config variable

THEN go into the resources tab on heroku, turn 'web' off and 'worker' on. 

voila you're done enjoy your piece of shit oc
kidding love you ttyl
